# Outreach Templates (decide.fyi)

## 1) Agent builder (DM)

Hey — I built **decide.fyi**: deterministic MCP notaries for subscription policies (refund/cancel/return/trial) + a live playground with audit trail.

If your agent touches subscription support, this gives you *auditable*, non-hallucinated policy verdicts (ALLOWED / PENALTY / etc.) in one call.

Want a 10-min setup? If you tell me the vendor(s) + region, I'll send a ready-to-run preset.

## 2) Agency (DM)

Hey — quick one: I built **decide.fyi** (open-source) to make subscription-policy decisions deterministic for agents.

If you ship agents for clients that handle refunds/cancellations/returns, this saves a lot of custom logic + debugging: MCP + playground + audit trail + export.

If you have 1 client use case, I can set up a pilot preset for you.

Subject: Deterministic refund/cancel notaries for your agent

Hi {{name}},

I run decide.fyi — deterministic MCP notaries for subscription policies (refund/cancel/return/trial) plus a live playground with audit trail.

If your agent handles subscription support, I can send a preset for your top vendors and a 5-minute integration.

Are you the right person to talk to?

Thanks,
{{you}}
